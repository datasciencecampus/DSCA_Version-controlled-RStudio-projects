# Version controlled RStudio projects

A repo to deposit learning materials for "Version controlled projects in RStudio"

**Description**

RStudio has the ability to use version control for R projects using a very easy to use graphical interface.

In this workshop we will focus on Git/GitHub-version-controlled R projects.


The pre-requisites for this workshop are that you have taken the "Version  control with Git and GitHub" workshop and that you are familiar with R and RStudio, preferably by having taken "Data Science with R".
