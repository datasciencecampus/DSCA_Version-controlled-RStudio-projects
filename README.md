# Version controlled RStudio projects

### Version 1.0

**Course Summary**  
RStudio has the ability to use version control for R projects using a very easy to use graphical interface. In this course we will introduce how R Studio has integrated Git version control into its interface. This allows developers to efficiently track changes in their code over time and effectively collaborate with a team of programmers. This course explains how to use the Git workflow to revise and track changes to an r markdown document, ultimately publishing your own version to web. 

**Learning Objective**  
Learners will be able to use R Studios integrated Git features to improve their ability to track changes and collaborate in their code.
