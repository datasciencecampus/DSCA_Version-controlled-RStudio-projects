# Version controlled RStudio projects

### Version 1.0

**Course Duration**

**Course Summary**  

RStudio has the ability to use version control for R projects using a very easy to use graphical interface.

This allows developers to efficiently track changes in their code over time and effectively collaborate with a team of programmers. This course explains how to use the Git workflow to revise and track changes to an r markdown document, ultimately publishing your own version to web.
